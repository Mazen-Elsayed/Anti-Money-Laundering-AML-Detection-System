ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (AML) DETECTION MODEL - FINAL DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

Date: 2025-12-08 22:23:29

1. MODEL SELECTION
   Selected Model: XGBoost
   
   Rationale:
   - After comparing Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost
   - XGBoost achieved the best balance of recall and F1 score
   - Critical for AML: High recall to catch fraudulent transactions
   - Acceptable precision to minimize false alarms

2. MODEL PERFORMANCE
   Optimal Threshold: 0.7000
   
   Metrics on Test Set:
   - Accuracy:  0.9480
   - Precision: 0.8616
   - Recall:    0.8197 (PRIMARY METRIC)
   - F1 Score:  0.8402
   - ROC-AUC:   0.9656
   
   Confusion Matrix:
   - True Negatives:  9,613
   - False Positives: 260
   - False Negatives: 356
   - True Positives:  1,619

3. TRAINING DATA
   - Total samples: 59,238
   - Training samples: 47,390
   - Test samples: 11,848
   - Number of features: 82
   - Class imbalance handled: Yes (using class weighting/scaling)

4. KEY FEATURES (Top 5)
   82. number_transactions: 0.3742
   29. Received_currency_UK pounds: 0.1078
   81. num_incoming: 0.0414
   73. Payment_type_Cross-border: 0.0376
   80. total_incoming: 0.0294

5. MODEL USAGE
   Files Saved:
   - Model: models/final_model.pkl
   - Threshold: models/optimal_threshold.txt
   - Metadata: models/model_metadata.json
   - Features: models/feature_names.txt
   
   To use the model:
   1. Load model: joblib.load('models/final_model.pkl')
   2. Load threshold from file
   3. Get probabilities: model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]
   4. Apply threshold: predictions = (probabilities >= threshold)

6. WHY THIS MODEL WAS CHOSEN
   
   Primary Goal: Detect as many money laundering cases as possible (HIGH RECALL)
   
   Trade-offs Considered:
   - False Positives (flagging legitimate transactions): Acceptable - can be reviewed
   - False Negatives (missing fraud): COSTLY - must minimize
   - Model complexity: Balanced - XGBoost provides good interpretability
   
   Business Impact:
   - Recall of 81.97% means we catch 81.97% of fraud cases
   - Precision of 86.16% means 86.16% of alerts are true fraud
   - False positive rate: 2.63% of legitimate transactions flagged

7. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEPLOYMENT
   - Use this model for automated screening of transactions
   - Flagged transactions should be reviewed by compliance team
   - Monitor model performance regularly
   - Retrain periodically with new data
   - Adjust threshold based on business needs and review capacity

8. NEXT STEPS (NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PROJECT)
   - Build API endpoint for real-time predictions
   - Create monitoring dashboard
   - Implement automated retraining pipeline
   - Deploy to production environment
